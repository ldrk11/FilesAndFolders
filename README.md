# FilesAndFolders! TypeScript interpreter
FilesAndFolders! is an esolang made by me and this is an interpreter for it!
You can find the [esolangs.org](https://esolangs.org) page [here.](https://esolangs.org/wiki/FilesAndFolders!)

To learn how to use the language go here [FilesAndFolders!.md](FilesAndFolders!.md).

Install Modules:
```
npm install
```
Compile typescript:
```
tsc
```
Once you've compiled the typescript you can run a folder like this:
```
node . C:/MySuperCoolProgram/
```
